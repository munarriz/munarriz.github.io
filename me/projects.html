        "Your first projects aren't the greatest things in the world, and they may have no money value, they may go nowhere, but that is how you learn - you put so much effort into making something right if it is for yourself." - Steve Wozniak</p>

    <h2><a href="https://github.com/RecordRacers/RecordRacer">Record Racer</a></h2>
        <p class="lead leftMargin rightMargin">
            November 2015 - April 2016<br>
            I worked with three others to create Record Racer, an Android application for runners and cyclists. The app changes the speed of the user's music to match their pace, making it feel like they are powering the music and motivating them to stay on pace. Personally, I was responsible for managing user accounts and authentication, the design of the data model, and integrating a database into the user interface. For this, I decided to use Couchbase Lite. There was no need to deal with the hassle of a relational data store when this document based NoSQL solution worked just as well for the purposes of the project.

        <h2><a href="http://www.scholars.ufl.edu/Nicholas-Munarriz.aspx">Computational & Analytic Number Theory Research</a></h2>
        <p class="lead leftMargin rightMargin">
            January 2015 - December 2015<br>
            I worked with Dr. Francis Garvan at the University of Florida on a research project which was funded by the University Scholars Program. The project focuses on properties of modular groups in SL2(Z), particularly those related to the transformations that they create on the complex plane.

        <h2>Postfix</h2>
        <p class="lead leftMargin rightMargin">
            May 2015<br>
            I used Swift to create an iOS application called Postfix. It is a simple 4 function calculator which uses postfix notation and has the option of allowing the user to see the stack as they make calculations. It has the goal of helping those who struggle to understand postfix notation clearly by letting them visualize exactly what happens at each operation.

        <h2><a href="https://github.com/cen3031-socks/socks">Save Our Cats & Kittens</a></h2>
        <p class="lead leftMargin rightMargin">
            January 2015 - April 2015<br>
            I did full stack web development with a small team to help create an internal management system for Save Our Cats & Kittens inc, a Florida cat shelter. The system allowed employees and volunteers to manage every cat ever admitted to the shelter as well as associated veterinarians, fosterers, adopters, and those who brought the cats in. The system also kept track of monetay & food donations. I was responsible for implementing a system allowing volunteers to sign in and out on a computer so that their hours could be tracked automatically, and employees could keep track of how many hours were volunteered over a time period of their choice by any given volunteer. The site used AngularJS on the front end and Express along with MongoDB to implement the back end and the database.

        <h2>Disassembler</h2>
        <p class="lead leftMargin rightMargin">
            November 2015<br>
            I wrote a disassembler using C++ which accepts a binary file as input and reverse engineers it, turning it into MIPS assembly code.
        </p>
        <h2>Map Implementation</h2>
        <p class="lead leftMargin rightMargin">
            November 2015 - December 2015<br>
            I created nearly a dozen implementations of maps including AVL trees, randomized bianary search trees, a separate chaining hash map, and a few different types open addressing hash maps with various probing strategies and hashing functions. A research report was written on the performance of these maps on different types of keys and inputs.
        </p>
        <h2>Scientific Calculator Implementaiton</h2>
        <p class="lead leftMargin rightMargin">
            March 2014 - May 2014<br>
            Worked on a team to help create a calculator in C++ which was responsible for parsing expressions including logarithms, fractions, Nth roots, exponential expressions, and constants such as e or pi. It would then evaluate these expressions applying the correct order of operations and return the simplest form of the solution that does not involve estimation. For example 8/6 -> 4/3 and log8(128) -> log8(64*2) -> log8(64) + log8(2) -> 2 + 1/3 -> 7/2.
        </p>
        <h2>Top Eight</h2>
        <p class="lead leftMargin rightMargin">
            June 2013 - July 2013<br>
            I single handedly designed the website www.topeight.com and wrote all of the code in use on it as well as some of the content.
