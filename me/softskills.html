    <p class="lead text-center leftMargin rightMargin">
        "A boss creates fear, a leader confidence. A boss fixes blame, a leader corrects mistakes. A boss knows all, a leader asks questions. A boss makes work drudgery, a leader makes it interesting." - Russell H. Ewing</p>
    <div class="leftMargin">
    	<h2>Teamwork</h2>
        <p class="lead leftMargin rightMargin">
            I love working on teams. Most people in individual contributor roles that I've met see teams as a negative thing because they can't control their teammates. I couldn't disagree with their analysis more. If all team members are on the same page and work is efficiently distributed, working on a team can lead to huge jumps in productivity. Often in team settings, I take it upon myself to work with members to delegate work in order to maximize the strengths of team members and lead to greater overall output.
        </p>
        <h2>Problem Solving</h2>
        <p class="lead leftMargin rightMargin">
            Due to my STEM background, I've been exposed to a crazy amount of problems. Sometimes these problems take a technical form and can involve proving an interesting mathematical result or writing an algorithm for a programming competition. Sometimes though, these problems take less technical approaches. I've solved problems that are part of a case competition as well as problems regarding product development.
        </p>
        <h2>Flexibility</h2>
        <p class="lead leftMargin rightMargin">
            As is often the case when developing software, things rarely go according to plan. I've lost count of the number of times that my team has had to completely restart a project due to a framework limitation or that we've had had to change critical features of the project due to changing customer constraints.
        </p>
        <h2>Communication</h2>
        <p class="lead leftMargin rightMargin">
            This is one of those skills that I practice multiple times every day. There's a stereotype that software engineers spend all their time hunched over a keyboard coding, but that couldn't be further from the truth. When there are multiple people, sometimes more than a dozen, all working simultaneously on code that interacts at hundreds of points, communication is absolutely critical. This extends outside of immediate teams. Regular communication with clients is also absolutely vital.
        </p>
        <h2>Passion</h2>
        <p class="lead leftMargin rightMargin">
            Laziness is not in my vocabulary. For better or for worse, once I decide that I'm doing something, I become extremely passionate about it. When I work on a project, I make it my personal goal to accomplish it more efficiently and effectively than any project I've ever worked on before.
